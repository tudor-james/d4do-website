										<h3 style='line-height:150%'>Preface<o:p></o:p></h3>
									
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>If you are involved in delivering
										technology products in any capacity, such as consulting, management, or
										technical, then this book is for you. I will give you a structured approach to
										increasing efficiency in technology delivery within your organization. It will
										help you understand what DevOps is, why you should embrace it within your
										organization, and how to integrate it with your broader business frameworks.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Digital Transformation is the
										restructuring of organizations to deliver digital products more efficiently
										while decreasing the cost and increasing the pace of product development,
										delivery, and innovation. DevOps is a crucial ingredient of Digital
										Transformation as it brings a cultural and technological approach to embedding
										these ideologies in our processes.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Designed4DevOps is a
										product-centric, holistic approach to the digital transformation of
										organizations engaged in digital product delivery. It explains how we can learn
										from decades of learning in optimizing production lines for physical product
										delivery and apply it to the pipelines of digital product delivery. The section
										below outlines the main chapters and parts of the book.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>We will focus on the four phases of
										the life cycle of a typical digital product: Design, Development, Use, and
										Disposal. By optimizing the pipeline for the whole life of the product from the
										outset, we can optimize the overall lead times for delivering changes to it.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Gartner claimed that the Digital
										Transformation market was at USD 284.38 billion in 2019 and expect it to expand
										at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% from 2020 to 2027. Gartner
										also predicts DevOps to reach USD 12.85 billion by 2025, an 18.60% CAGR during
										the forecast period.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>It is a fair generalization to say
										that most organizations are IT organizations today. Very few organizations
										could survive without technology. Many organizations choose to customize or buy
										bespoke software to service their core business. Many others are in the
										business of selling digital products from apps and games through to enterprise
										systems.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The speed at which we can deliver
										change to our core products can mean the difference between leading a market
										segment or being left behind in it.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>What I aim to do with
										Designed4Devops, and the framework it provides is to give you a structure in
										which you can use DevOps to design and deliver Digital Transformation within
										your organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>About the Author<o:p></o:p></h3>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>I have worked in IT for over twenty
										years, delivering large-scale change and transformation. I am a Technical Director
										at Worldline, multi-national payments, and digital services company. I am a
										Senior Expert within Worldlines Expert Community. I deliver multiple digital
										products, and I am working on digital transformation in areas such as DevOps
										and cloud technologies. I successfully transitioned our UK operations function
										to an agile and DevOps practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For
										this <span class=SpellE>endeavor</span>, I won the DevOps Leader of the Year
										award at the Computing Digital Technology Leaders Awards 2019. I have worked in
										various industries, including finance, financial services, regulated energy,
										transport, media, and gaming. My experience covers the full product life cycle,
										from bringing products to market with start-ups, large enterprises,
										multi-national systems integrators, and service-oriented organizations.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Why I Wrote This Book<o:p></o:p></h3>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Digital Transformation is an
										in-vogue topic. Many people extol the virtues of becoming a digital-speed
										organization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But amongst all this
										opinion, finding a sense of what we are transforming to is difficult to find.<span
										style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We need to understand the target state and
										how we get there. Most of us know or at least feel that we need to transform,
										but it is sometimes difficult to see what we need to turn into and how we
										achieve that transformation.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>DevOps is the application of
										physical manufacturing efficiencies applied to digital production. In its
										current form, this analogy only takes us so far. In physical production, the
										aim is to deliver an optimized flow of homogenous products. Digital products,
										once produced, have an unlimited distribution with digital downloads. The main
										difference in digital product delivery is that we are not delivering products
										in our pipeline but delivering changes to our products. Change is key to growth
										as, without it, we stagnate and fall behind our competitors. Digital
										marketplaces move quickly, so we need to introduce change efficiently into our
										products. By making product delivery the <span class=SpellE>center</span> of
										our organizations digital transformation, we can optimize our efficiencies to
										grow.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>There is a wealth of information on
										DevOps out there and some excellent books about aspects of it.<span
										style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, I found it challenging to pull all
										the elements together into a structured approach. And none that put change at
										the heart of what we are trying to achieve with digital transformation. As a
										technical architect and engineer, this is how I prefer to see challenges, with
										a methodological and structured approach that can be repeated and tested for
										its results.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In this book, I have created a
										structured framework for identifying and prioritizing those areas of your
										organization that are holding you back and, as such, are in most need of
										change. You will learn first how to identify and measure your value streams and
										understand how they interact and, most importantly, why this is important. You
										will learn how to redesign these value streams to optimize the flow of change
										through them. You will also learn how to integrate these value streams into
										your broader business frameworks such as procurement, approval, security, and
										service management. Along the way, you will see the positive patterns
										throughout the product life cycle that enhance these flows and how to replicate
										them in your organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>About this book<o:p></o:p></h3>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>This book is for anyone working in
										or considering the digital transformation of organizations that create digital
										products. It uses DevOps and the optimization of delivering change as its core.
										Still, it shows you how to approach it structurally and repeatedly. It also
										shows you how to design your product delivery and integrate it into the broader
										business frameworks such as security and service management.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The book is in four parts. I am an
										engineer at heart; my instinct is to break tasks down into manageable parts. In
										digital transformation, I have applied engineering principles to break down
										digital product delivery problems. An organization is a complex system like any
										other. By taking a systematic approach and addressing issues in
										easier-to-handle components, we can bring about meaningful change. Part I is
										the WHY of the issue. Within Part I, we are introduced to meaningful
										definitions of the issues that lie before us and the tools we will use to
										resolve them. In Part II, we get into the details of the WHO, HOW, and WHEN. It
										is about breaking the problem down and understanding the flow of change
										occurring within our products and where we are introducing waste. Part III is
										the WHAT. It is a model product pipeline with all the technical detail for
										introducing <span class=GramE>best-practice</span> to improve flow and reduce
										waste. Part IV contains some real-world case-studies to help understand how it
										works in practice.<o:p></o:p></p>

										<h3 style='line-height:150%'>Part I - WHY - Lean in a Digital World<o:p></o:p></h3>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Every company is a technology
										company, yet somehow, we <span class=GramE>dont</span> seem to have the same
										efficiencies in delivering digital products as we do with physical ones.
										Manufacturing has seen massive gains in productivity over the last century. We
										need to take lessons from the physical industries and apply them to the digital
										world.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The buzzword for this drive towards
										technology delivery efficiency is Digital Transformation. But what is it?
										What does a digitally transformed organization look like, and what is the
										problem with our current state?<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>There are some standard approaches
										to increasing efficiency in physical production which come under the umbrella
										of lean. Its counterpoint in digital production is called DevOps.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>There is a fundamental difference
										between physical and digital production, which I elaborate on here. I introduce
										change as the unit of delivery in the digital production line.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>What is Lean?<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>I present a brief history of lean
										and what it seeks to achieve in physical production lines. I draw out the
										high-level principles of lean and show how they help to increase efficiency and
										productivity. I introduce the concept of waste as defined by lean and plant the
										seed of why we need to remove it systematically.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>What is DevOps?<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>This section is an overview of
										DevOps, its origins, and how it relates to lean. I talk about how some common
										misconceptions about what it is. I start here with a very high-level definition
										of what it is and why it is essential.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>The Digital Production Line<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Here, I introduce to the concept of
										the production line for digital products, known as the pipeline. I discuss the
										principle difference between physical production and digital production,
										namely, that the individual units we process are conceptual changes rather than
										physical products.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Flow<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The essence of what we want to
										improve is the rate at which we make changes to our products. Flow is essential
										to tracking, measuring, and improving the rate of change. Flow represents the
										steps taken by individuals and groups to progress a change from inception to
										release.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Culture<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Some cultures facilitate change,
										and others hinder it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We need to shift
										from top-down, enforced micromanagement of tasks to a high-trust,
										self-organizing, pull-based approach to our workloads. A self-organizing culture
										is essential for improving flow and the health and well-being of the people
										within it.<o:p></o:p></p>

										<h3 style='line-height:150%'>Part II - WHO HOW and WHEN - Getting Started<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>To start the digital
										transformation, we need to set up our kaizen effort. We need to know whom to
										engage with, understand what people to put in place, and decide which products
										we will begin to improve. We will use the extended Deming cycle to guide our
										actions; Observe, Plan, Do, Check, and Adjust. <o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Observe<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>It is imperative to stand back and
										understand any complex system before you start to change it. An organization is
										a complex system like any other. My approach is a reductionist engineering one;
										decompose the system into less complicated and more understandable components
										that are less daunting and risky to alter. These are the critical areas of
										focus to understand when researching your current organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>This section also introduces us to
										two critical tools that we will use to <span class=SpellE>analyze</span> and
										plan changes to our pipelines, the Product Lifecycle and Value Stream Mapping.
										We will look at identifying stakeholders and how to engage them. Together, we
										will use the four phases of a product lifecycle with Designed4Devops unique
										hierarchical value stream mapping approach to understand flow within our
										organization. We will learn the definitions of waste and how to identify waste
										within our pipelines.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Plan<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>We will first look at how to
										identify our first product pipeline for transformation and select a value
										stream map to improve. We will look at the product and value stream
										dependencies, how they interrupt the flow, and how we can improve it. We will
										learn how to scale our kaizen effort up to portfolios of products and
										prioritize them.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Do<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Firstly, we need to put the product
										manager in place. We look at the skills required and the role they will take
										on. We will look at building teams around the product and establishing a
										positive culture that communicates effectively and openly.<span
										style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I introduce Agile to manage the flow of work
										to increase the flow of changes through our pipeline.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Check<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Actions have consequences, both
										positive and negative. We must use feedback to change our actions and learn
										from our mistakes.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Adjust<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>We must continually re-align our
										kaizen effort with our stated goals using the feedback we receive.<o:p></o:p></p>

									<section>
										<h3 style='line-height:150%'>Part III - WHAT - A Model Value Stream<o:p></o:p></h3>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>This section is about learning the
										positive patterns we <span class=GramE>have to</span> increase flow in a value
										stream. We will become familiar with all the techniques, approaches,
										technologies, and tools that increase digital product delivery flow.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Design Phase<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Much of the inefficiency in a
										pipeline occurs before developers writing any code. We will look at a model
										approach to streamline the prioritization of changes. We will examine the
										positive patterns employed to increase flow throughout design, approval,
										procurement, and logistics.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Development Phase<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In development, we will look at the
										power of delegation and self-service using tools such as automation,
										orchestration, and abstraction. It increases flow through development, staging,
										testing, and release.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Use Phase<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
										<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Feedback is critical to
										improvement. We will look at all the metrics we should try to capture in both
										product and pipeline to use kaizen to bring about positive change effectively.<o:p></o:p></p>
										
										<h4 style='line-height:150%'>Disposal Phase<o:p></o:p></h4>
										
		uery								<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>To minimize disruption to other
